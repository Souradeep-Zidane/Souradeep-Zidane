Hello. My name is Souradeep and I am an aspiring Embedded Systems engineer.

I have previously worked with microcontrollers like Arduino UNO, Particle Photon, ESP32, ESP32-CAM, AVR ATmega16, ATmega32 & ARM LPC2148. 
I am still learning the basics and working my way to create a project that I can claim fully as my own. 

Thanks for visiting.😁
